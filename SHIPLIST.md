## ⚠️ **CRITICAL ISSUES TO RESOLVE** (15% Remaining)

### 🔴 **HIGH PRIORITY** - Must Fix Before Launch

#### 1. **Code Quality Issues** - 97 ESLint Violations
**Impact**: Code maintainability and potential runtime issues
**Estimated Fix Time**: 4-6 hours

**Breakdown by Category**:
- **TypeScript `any` types**: 35 instances
  - `src/lib/analytics.ts`: 12 instances
  - `src/lib/supabase.ts`: 5 instances
  - Edge functions: 18 instances
- **Unused variables**: 25 instances
  - Import statements not used
  - Function parameters not used
  - Variable assignments unused
- **Switch case declarations**: 23 instances
  - Missing block scopes in switch statements
- **React Hooks dependencies**: 4 warnings
  - Missing dependency warnings

**Action Required**:
```bash
# Fix automatically resolvable issues
npm run lint -- --fix

# Manual fixes needed for:
# - Type definitions (replace 'any' with proper types)
# - Remove unused imports and variables
# - Add block scopes to switch cases
# - Fix React Hook dependencies
```

#### 2. **Font Resource Warnings**
**Impact**: Build warnings (non-critical but unprofessional)
**Status**: 20 font file warnings during build
**Fix**: Move font files to `public/` directory or configure Vite properly

#### 3. **Missing Test Suite**
**Impact**: No automated testing coverage
**Current**: Only E2E test plan documentation exists
**Needed**: 
- Unit tests for CSV processing engine
- Integration tests for payment flow
- E2E tests for critical user journeys

---

## 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY** - Recommended Before Launch

#### 1. **Performance Monitoring**
- **Missing**: Application performance monitoring
- **Needed**: Error tracking, performance metrics, user analytics
- **Recommendation**: Integrate Sentry or similar service

#### 2. **Documentation Completion**
- **Status**: Good documentation exists but needs updates
- **Missing**: 
  - API documentation for developers
  - User guide/help system
  - Troubleshooting guide

#### 3. **Security Review**
- **Current**: Basic security measures implemented
- **Needed**: Security audit of API endpoints and data handling
- **Recommendation**: Third-party security review

---

## 🟢 **LOW PRIORITY** - Post-Launch Improvements

#### 1. **Advanced Features**
- Bulk file processing
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Team collaboration features
- API access for developers

#### 2. **Performance Optimizations**
- Bundle size optimization
- Image optimization
- Caching strategies
- CDN integration

#### 3. **User Experience Enhancements**
- Onboarding tutorial
- Advanced help system
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Accessibility improvements
